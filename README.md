# LockdownRemedy

Video streaming webapp of pre-covid world

This is a small project that began as initially a way to test my own knowledge that I've learnt as a beginner in React to see what I could build. 


Live demonstration here - currently only supporting desktop platforms but still continuing development. 
I recommend opening the live preview in a new window as the intergrated browser is very buggy in the sandbox. 
You can open the live preview by visiting https://codesandbox.io/s/blazing-https-u0tdf to build the web app and then heading over to https://u0tdf.csb.app/ .


Currently supports 3 regions with 3 radio broadcasting stations.
