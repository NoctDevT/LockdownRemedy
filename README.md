# LockdownRemedy

Video streaming webapp of pre-covid world

This is a small project that began as initially a way to test my own knowledge that I've learnt as a beginner in React to see what I could build. 


Live demonstration here - currently only supporting desktop platforms but still continuing development. 
I recommend opening the live preview in a new window  https://codesandbox.io/s/young-night-gytcc


Currently supports 3 regions with 3 radio broadcasting stations.
